### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 

    Lab 1, this was memorable because it was the first-ever lab. This lab was a starting and learning point that guided me through the rest of the labs. I learned how to clone repositories and submit them to GitHub to be graded by my instructor.

* Lab 5 

    Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorites because I love sandwiches, and we created a fill-in-the-blank game. It was interesting to see that a simple program like this could be used in the real world for cashiers or ordering apps. We wrote a program using vectors that fills in the blanks for a sentence about a sandwich order.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was another favorite because it sparked the little kid in me who has always been passionate about creating video games. In this lab, we improved a high/low guessing game using a command line argument to better hide the secret number. The player has 5 tries to guess the secret number. If the player guessed incorrectly, they would receive a prompt indicating whether their guess was too high or too low. If they ran out of attempts, they would receive the prompt "you lose".
